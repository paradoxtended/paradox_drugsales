# ðŸ’Š prp-drugsales
Advanced drug selling system for FiveM roleplay servers. Highly optimized and secured so you don't have to worry about performance and cheaters or exploiters.
## ðŸ““ Features
- Highly configurable, configure almost everything (selling zones, selling prices, accept chance, report chance...).
- Experience, I used many animations so you and your players will have the best possible experience.
- Supports many dispatch scripts (rcore_dispatch, cd_dispatch, ps-dispatch ...), it has built-in dispatch if you don't have one of those dispatches.
- Logging system, every deal will be logged on your discord if you set your webhook key in config.lua file.
- Custom UI, like always each of our scripts has custom UI, this time I created UI for dealing with clients (like ProdigyRP).
- Ability to set your own sales zones and specific drugs that can only be sold in these zones. Set as many sales zones as you want.
- You can sell your drugs either everywhere or in the specified zones.
- Disabled jobs, jobs specified in Config.DisabledJobs can't sell drugs. Used for police, ambulance, sheriff, gov ...
- Dispatch or police jobs, jobs in Config.PoliceJobs will be alerted if your deal fails.
- Ability to change notifications and progress scripts, default are us (prp.notify and prp.progress from prp_lib)
- And much more soon ðŸ‘€ (on v1.0.0)
